    Dan please write interface code here (and any javascript files you need!)<br>
    CP library will expect same params as epoch {"mode(tr/pe)":"tr","gain(db)":"40","delay(us)":"0","time(us)":"10","freq(mhz)":"2.25","filtermode":"12"}<br><br>

    drop down menus might be nice for high and low pass filters (hpf and lpf). For example: 0=.6MHz, 1=0.8Mhz, 2=1.8MHz and so on and the user can select each one.
