    Dan please write interface code here (and any javascript files you need!)<br>
    CP library will expect {"gain" : "10.9", "mode(tr/pe)" : "tr", "lpf" : "(value between 0 and 7)", "hpf" : "(value between 0 and 3"}, "freq1" : "2.25", "freq2" : 10, "step" : ".25", "delay" : "10", "range : "35"}<br><br>

    drop down menus might be nice for high and low pass filters (hpf and lpf). For example: 0=.6MHz, 1=0.8Mhz, 2=1.8MHz and so on and the user can select each one.
